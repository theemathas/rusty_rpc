# rusty_rpc

Class project for the CS244b "Distributed System" class at Stanford during the Spring 2022 quarter.

An RPC implemented for the Rust programming language and designed to better use Rust's unique features.

TODO: Write some more stuff here.

For usage examples, see the `examples` directory. To run the `hello_world`
example, run `cargo run --bin hello_world_server`. Then, in another terminal,
you may run `cargo run --bin hello_world_client` any number of times. The client
will run, verify that it worked properly, print `Client done successfully!`,
then terminate. You'll need to manually terminate the server with ctrl-C.
